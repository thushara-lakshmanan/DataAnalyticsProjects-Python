    "The dataset we will be using contains information about Airbnb's hosts and their places in Melbourne, VIC, AU. The data was scraped from Airbnb's website by a tool called Inside Airbnb. Their website is fascinating and contains information not only on Melbourne but also on most of the cities around the world where Airbnb operates.\n",

    "Inside Airbnb periodically scrapes Airbnb's data, and we will be working with a Melbourne sample that was last scraped in 2018 that was posted in Kaggle. We will not have a list of the variables and what they represent since there are too many in the dataset for that. Instead, to learn more about the dataset you can navigate to the Kaggle post through this link, go to Airbnb and search for listings in Melbourne to see the information shown, or you can find more information about the datasets at Inside Airbnb Get the Data Section."
