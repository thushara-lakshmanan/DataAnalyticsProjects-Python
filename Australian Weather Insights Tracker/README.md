    "About the data:\n",
    "This dataset contains weather information from many of the weather stations around Australia. For most weather stations, we have about 365 observations for the years 2007 to 2017. More information about the dataset can be found in the Australian Bureau of Meteorology website, and below you can find a short description of the variables in the dataset.\n",

    "Variables info:\n",
    "\n",
    "Date --> day, month, and year of the observation, each weather station has its own\n",
    "Location --> location of the weather station\n",
    "MinTemp --> minimum temperature for that day\n",
    "MaxTemp --> maximum temperature for that day\n",
    "Rainfall --> the amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm\n",
    "Evaporation --> the so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am\n",
    "Sunshine --> the number of hours of bright sunshine in the day\n",
    "WindGustDir --> the direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight\n",
    "WindGustSpeed --> the speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight\n",
    "WindDir9am --> direction of the wind at 9am\n",
    "WindDir3pm --> direction of the wind at 3pm\n",
    "WindSpeed9am --> wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am\n",
    "WindSpeed3pm --> wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm\n",
    "Humidity9am --> humidity (percent) at 9am\n",
    "Humidity3pm --> humidity (percent) at 3pm\n",
    "Pressure9am --> atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am\n",
    "Pressure3pm --> atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm\n",
    "Cloud9am --> fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in \"oktas\", which are a unit of eigths. It records how many\n",
    "Cloud3pm --> fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in \"oktas\": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a description of the values\n",
    "Temp9am --> temperature (degrees C) at 9am\n",
    "Temp3pm --> temperature (degrees C) at 3pm\n",
    "RainToday --> boolean: 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0\n",
    "RISK_MM --> the amount of next day rain in mm. Used to create response variable RainTomorrow. A kind of measure of the \"risk\".\n",
    "RainTomorrow --> did it rain the following day?\n",
    "The dataset and the information for the variables was taken from Kaggle, and you can find out more about the dataset either using the link above or the one below, and about Kaggle using the link below.\n",
